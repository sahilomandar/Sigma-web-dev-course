        <p>The earliest noted adventures of humans with coding take us back to 60 A.D. Heron of Alexander was a Greek
            mathematician and engineer. He invented the machine that was used to control puppets with the help of
            strings. The machine could be reprogrammed by rearranging the strings to make the puppets do different
            things.</p>
        <p>The first computer programming language was created in 1883, when a woman named Ada Lovelace worked with
            Charles Babbage on his very early mechanical computer, the Analytical Engine.</p>
        <p>While the names of the coding paradigms sometimes vary, most experts agree on four primary types of code:
            imperative, functional, logical, and object-oriented. Alternative names and other primary types may include
            procedural, scripting, and database programming.</p>
        <p>FORTRAN (FORmula TRANslation) is the oldest, most universal language for programming computer systems. It was
            created in 1957 and is still used in many scientific and numerical applications.</p>
        <p>As of October 2023, Gennady is the highest-rated programmer on Codeforces, CodeChef, Topcoder, AtCoder and
            HackerRank. In January 2022, he achieved a historic rating of 3979 on Codeforces, becoming the first to
            break the 3900 barrier.</p>
